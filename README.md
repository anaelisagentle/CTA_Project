# CTA_Project

This project analyzes turnstile data from Chicago's L train to find the optimal location for a local buisiness owner's bakery. For an overview of the project, please see the [Executive Summary](https://github.com/anaelisagentle/CTA_Project/blob/master/ExecutiveSummary.pdf). To run the notebook, clone the repo to a local folder and open jupyter notebooks from your terminal.
